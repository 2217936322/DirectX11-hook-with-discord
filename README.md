Example of using discord overlay to render your stuff in target process.

Inject(loadlibrary or manualmap with hjackthread option, if you wont hack any thread create your own in dll main) in any game which support discord overlay and enjoy directx hook.
Discord is using minhook, so we can easily hook with it without writing our own library or pasting 1 from github
